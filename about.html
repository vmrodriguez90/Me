## About

Developer born and raised on Buenos Aires, Argentina who loves technology, sports, traveling, beer and jokes. <br/>
Sports made me be a humble, hungry and team player, it makes you want to be the best version of yourself. I've played Soccer, Swimmig, Grass-Hockey, Rugby. <br/>
Traveling made me know different things that i am used to and learn to live with it, be so interested about Cultures, and human contact. Also, i felt in love with the Nature, is something so interesting and magnificent. I like to travel alone cause there is always the chance to meet new people and cultures. But that doesn't mean that i don't enjoy to travel with friends. I love the both!
<br/>Beer made me enjoy the little things, a beer watching a match, a beer watching the landscape, nature, etc, beer with friends, the little things that makes you happy. <br/>
And obviously, i like to joke, but mostly, i like the humor. I'm a guy who always is in a good mood, and i like to share or i like to take the people to that mood, so, i would do anything for make everyone be on a good mood!
