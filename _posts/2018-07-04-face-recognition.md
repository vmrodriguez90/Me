Today we are gonna be throwing a meetup at ORT University at Almagro, BA.

We are gonna talk about Object detection, Face Detection, Face Analysis and Face Recognition.

This is was created to promote the innovation and encourage the students and the future devs to get excited about technology and
different new tools that are the present right now.

Let's start with a little bit of History: Object Detection has been around since 60s/70s. This basically was possible by some tools called Classifiers.
These Classifiers where like models to compare with images. So, for example, they had a Classifier for detect Apples (?) that was rules for check
in some way if in an image there was an APPLE. But wasn't that easy to find an apple, first they had to divide the image in different sections.
These sections were divided by geometric figures as lines etc. And then all the sections were analized by these rules or Classifiers to detect the final object on all the sections.

So as we see, these wasn't an easy job. In 2000/2005 to analyze an image and get a response of there was an object or not, might took 20 seconds at least. And was just for one simple object.

But now, after the technology started to make an improvement, and we started to have more GPU to work with, These changed to a way where the object started to be analyzed once and by different classifiers.

This method is called YOLO (You Only Look Once).

Right now, the different ways we have to analyze images are Deep Learning or Machine Learning.

Both techniques we need firstable to train the PC, show different options and mark the corrected ones to teach the PC what is what we want to detect.

These needs a massive volume of Data to get better results. To create this classifier we might need human supervision to make sure is the right result.

Machine Learning starts with patrons and rules to identify object, but with more data, these can modify the Algorhytms to make more specify the result.

Deep Learning requires big CPU cause it basically simulates a Brain, a Neurone Network, where it takes deep details from the different images.
